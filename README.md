# RAG Query Package

This package is designed to manage querying a language model (LLM) with context retrieved from documents. 
It works by taking a user's query, retrieving relevant context, and sending the combined information to the LLM to generate a response.

## Features

- Retrieve context from a vector store (e.g., Chroma).
- Send queries to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) along with relevant context.
- Modular and easy-to-use design.
